# Bank Admin System
This is a cmd bank admin environment for study demonstrations.  

# What does this program do?
You (as a bank admin) add, remove or modify the bank accounts and the balances, also make transactions between them.  
There is NO database, there is just a json format file imitating a database (which is an array of the accounts, that's all).
